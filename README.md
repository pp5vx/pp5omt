This is a ( World's First ? ) HF WX Telemetry CW Beacon

A very simple WX (Weather) CW (Continuos Wave) Beacon on HF

They are widely utilized for Amateur Radio purposes, all over the World

Purpose: To study "eletromagnetic propagation" in real time ( ..."old school" approach ! LOL ) 

So, on HF (from 3 MHZ to 30 MHZ), and in a "Low Band" - ours - is the **First** (?)

Initially, made with a low end 12F Family PIC ( 12F675 and after a 12F683 )

So, we discover Arduino (Nano R3) very cheap, readilly available, and easy to change !

We pull out PIC, and changed to Arduino, after hooked all things to a Motorola "Micon-S"

( this Micon-S has been a very wellcome gift from an OT, and **for all of you** ! )
