PP5OMT: The World's First WX CW Beacon

This is a very simple WX (Weather) CW (Continuos Wave) Beacon
They are widely utilized for Amateur Radio purposes, all over the World 

Initially I made it with a low end 12F PIC ( a "12F683" )
But the Arduino Nano R3 is very cheap and readly availabe, so...
But, our is the FIRST in the World active on a HF Band ( LOL ) 

You can look more (the "real thing" !) here: www.qrz.com.db/pp5vx

Enjoy !
