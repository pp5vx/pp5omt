This is a (World's First ?) HF WX Telemetry CW Beacon !

A very simple WX (Weather) CW (Continuos Wave) Beacon on HF

They are widely utilized for Amateur Radio purposes, all over the World

Purpose: To study "eletromagnetic propagation" in real time ( ..."old school" approach ! LOL ) 

So, on HF (from 3 MHZ to 30 MHZ), and in a "Low Band" - ours - is the **First** (?)

Initially, made with a low end 12F PIC ( 12F675 and after, a 12F683 )

We discover Arduino ( Nano R3 ) that's very cheap, readily available, and easy to change

We pull out PIC, and changed to Arduino, after hooked all things to a Motorola "Micon-S"

( this Micon-S be very wellcome gift from an OT ! And for all of you ! )
