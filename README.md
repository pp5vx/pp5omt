The ( World's First ? ) HF WX Telemetry CW Beacon !

This is a very simple WX (Weather) CW (Continuos Wave) Beacon

They are widely utilized for Amateur Radio purposes, all over the World

To study "eletromagnetic propagation" in real time ( ...an "old school" approach ! LOL ) 

But on HF (3 MHZ to 30 MHZ) that are ours, in a "Low Band", is the **very First** !

Initially, made it with a low end 12F PIC ( "12F675 or 12F683" )

But the Arduino Nano R3 is very cheap, ready availabe, easy to change...

So, put a cheap Arduino, hooked to a Motorola "Micon-S" gifted from an OT...

... and ours is the very first WX "Low HF Band" Beacon, in the whole World !

You can look more ( somewhat the "real thing" ! ) here: www.qrz.com/db/pp5omt

Enjoy !
